# Cypress Automation Study Project

Welcome to my personal automation study project! ðŸŽ‰  

As a **QA Engineer**, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work with various languages, tools, and frameworks throughout my career. After spending some time focused on other areas, Iâ€™m returning to automation and created this project as part of my learning journey.

## Purpose

This repository serves two primary purposes:
1. **Learning and Practice**: To apply concepts and exercises from the automation courses Iâ€™m currently taking.
2. **Personal Library**: To document notes, patterns, and solutions that will act as a reference for future projects.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using:
- **OS: Linux**
- **IDE: Visual Studio Code**  
- **Programming language: JavaScript**  
- **Testing framework: Cypress**  
- **Testing framework: Mocha**
- **Library: JQuery**
- **Git/GitHub**  

## Goals

1. Reinforce automation testing skills.  
2. Explore and document advanced Cypress features.  
3. Practice Git workflows and improve repository management using GitHub.  
4. Create a reusable resource for future projects.
